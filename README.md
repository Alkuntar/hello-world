# hello-world

Welcome to my Github account! Included, you'll find code I have written in JavaScript to be used as plugin scripts in an RPG game I'm making with RPG Maker MV. This is code I put together fast to get the job done. I can work on refining it for faster speed in the future, but these examples will suffice for now.

You can play a short demo of the game here: http//www.harriscoding.com/portfolio.html. In reviewing the code, you'll notice that I am using functions that are part of the Core JavaScript functions RPG Maker MV games are built on. I'm also using functions from additional Plugin scripts I have added to my game that were created by Quasi and Galv that have given permission for their plugins to be used. Don't hesitate to leave your comments if you have any questions.
